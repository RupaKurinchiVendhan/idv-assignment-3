				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Seasonal Trends:</b>  The visualization shows cycles of COVID-19 cases spiraling outward in quarterly (three months) intervals, suggesting that each year saw increasing peaks in case numbers.
				<li><b>Comparison Across Variants:</b> The Omicron surge (early 2022) is by far the most dramatic, dwarfing previous surges, which suggests that even though Delta (mid-to-late 2021) was severe, Omicron led to an unprecedented spike in cases.
				<li><b>Comparing Yearly Peaks:</b> The case numbers appear to be highest around the same seasonal periods each year, particularly in winter months (January), highlighting a pattern of increased transmission during colder seasons.
				<li><b>Impact of Public Health Interventions:</b>  The structure of the curves might reflect how interventions (e.g., vaccines, mask mandates, or social distancing) affected case numbers at different points in time. The 2021 loop is larger than 2020, but the largest jump is seen in 2022, possibly due to Omicron's high transmissibility despite vaccination efforts.
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of what works well, this spiral visualization is effective at communicating the cyclical nature of COVID-19 case surges. This format allows for direct year-over-year comparisons while preserving the seasonality of case peaks. The subtle radial grid gives a simple representation of time despite its unconventional layout. I like the use of the 7-day moving average to smooth out fluctuation and make trends clearer. Since this plot is included at the very top of the NYT opinion piece, it serves as an effective initial investigation and invitation to readers to learn more about historical trends in COVID cases, setting the stage well for the coming predictive analysis about the Omicron variant by providing historical context for the expected rise in cases in the coming months.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the spiral format, while visually striking, introduces challenges for precise data interpretation. The outward expansion from the center can make it difficult to directly compare non-peak values or assess exact case counts at a given point in time. Unlike a linear time series, the curvature of the data may obscure smaller trends, and estimating values without a clearer scale could be challenging for some viewers. The key on the top left of the visualization shows roughly how the width of the curves relate to the number of cases, but it would be helpful to more quantitatively and explicitly compare case counts without having to refer to a separate key. Especially considering that the visualization is in an online article, the viewer might have to scroll or shift their eyes frequently to quantify the red shading in the spiral. Additionally, this visualization does not contextualize the Omicron surge and convey how interventions or changes in reporting practices influenced case numbers over time (although admittedly this information may overwhelm and distract from the purpose of setting the stage for the article). The discussion in the article that follows the visualization centers around seasonal variation and comparing the predicted progression of Omicron to that of Delta. In particular, there is a visualization that uses line plots by month to compare over time to specifically highlight the difference in case counts between January 2022 and January 2021. While the spiral plot serves to set the stage for the article by providing high level context for how cases gradually ebbed and flowed over time up until when the article was released, this line plot is much more precise and easy to quantitatively interpret how Omicron is projected to differ from Delta. Overall, the visualization succeeds in making a powerful visual statement about the escalating nature of the pandemic but may sacrifice some precision and accessibility for a general audience.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="figs/viz1.jpeg" width=1000 alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This interactive spiral visualization captures the seasonality and magnitude of COVID-19 case surges, with hover-enabled quantitative details and key event markers providing insight into major interventions, variant emergences, and policy changes over time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> I wanted to build on the original visualization to allow for contextualized and quantitative year-by-year comparisons while maintaining the expressive and cyclical nature of the original spiral visualization.</li>
				<li> As discussed earlier, the spiral plot conveys relative magnitude of COVID-19 case surges each year, making it clear which waves were the most severe, as well as seasonal patterns over multiple years, reinforcing the trend of winter peaks and summer declines. </li>
				<li> To add more context withouting the visualization, I added interactive components with markers for key events on variants and interventions, providing critical context for why cases may be increasing or decreasing. Additionally, the quantitative detail on hover allows users to see exact case counts per month (something that was lacking from the original plot) while maintaining the overall shape of the visualization.</li>
				<li> This version requires more space, particularly to ensure that event markers and hover elements do not clutter the visualization. With the markers and quantitative information, it could be overwhelming for a reader, especially when left as the first visualization in the NYT opinion piece. </li>
				<li> I thought a simpler line chart for each year would help with reducing the amount of clutter on the page, while still allowing for a quantitative comparison across years and seasons.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/viz2.jpeg" width=1000 alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					By overlaying multiple years in a standard line chart, this visualization makes it easier to compare COVID-19 waves, identify seasonal trends, and assess the impact of public health interventions, without the distortion introduced by the spiral format.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> I wanted to reduce visual clutter from the previous sketch even further and keep the quantitative year-by-year comparisons. I thought about having stacked line charts for each year, but decided in favor of compressing each year's data into one plot. By overlaying multiple years on the same plot, this iteration allows viewers to see seasonal patterns and compare waves across the years without having to interpret the width of the radial plot.</li>
				<li> Compared to the radial plot, this visualization more clearly shows the relative magnitude of case surges seasonally and in different years. It continues to emphasize seasonality, showing recurring winter peaks and summer declines.  </li>
				<li> By using multiple color-coded lines--one for each year--this visualization ensures that each year's trend remains distinct yet comparable. Unlike the spiral plot, where case counts can be harder to quantify while referring to the legend, this design gives precise numerical values on a consistent scale. This format shows seasonality while making it more intuitive for year-over-year comparisons. Users can also easily identify crossover points where certain years saw more or fewer cases than others at the same time of year.</li>
				<li> This approach results in a sparse visualization, particularly because there isn't sufficient data across the years to compare. Additionally, we lose information about continuous trends between the years that we get from the radial plot.</li>
				<li> Next, I wanted to try a continuous time-series chart. This would allow for an uninterrupted view of the entire pandemic, rather than forcing yearly comparisons that may not align perfectly with significant trends. </li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/viz3.jpeg" width=1000 alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This continuous time-series visualization presents the full progression of the pandemic, allowing for precise comparisons of case surges across months and years while highlighting the effects of interventions, vaccines, and policy shifts in a clear, uninterrupted format.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> In this iteration, I wanted to present a direct, unbroken view of the pandemic's progression while keeping the quantitative line plot format. </li>
				<li> This visualization keeps the trends shown in the cyclical nature of the COVID-19 case surges from the original version, while also making the relative intensity of different waves across years more apparent and easy to quantify. Additionally, inspired by my first sketch, I chose to include an interactive hover effect to highlight events and case counts per month to contextualize the effects of interventions and other key events. </li>
				<li> The color-coding allows for a clear separation of years while maintaining a smooth progression of case trends over time. This makes it easier to compare the intensity of waves across months and years without the need to mentally reconstruct timelines. </li>
				<li> The ability to precisely annotate key interventions and variant surges makes this visualization strong as well, helping viewers connect policy actions with observed changes in case counts. </li>
				<li> One possible improvement would be to separate each year's data into a separate plot entirely. Another option I considered was to include subtle overlays for prior years' data, allowing for direct comparisons without breaking the continuity of the time series. I decided against this because I thought it would make the visualization too complex and difficult to interpret.</li>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>
			<!-- <p>
				 This visualization was designed to effectively communicate the evolving magnitude and trajectory of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths over time while maintaining an intuitive and engaging user experience. The goal was to emphasize temporal trends in the pandemic and provide a clear view of major waves and their impact. By animating the data, the visualization creates a sense of progression, reinforcing how different pandemic phases unfolded. Unlike static plots, this approach highlights the dynamic nature of the data, making it easier to track surges, declines, and turning points. The interactive elements allow users to pause, replay, and examine specific points, ensuring that crucial details are not lost in the animation. The timeline is limited to March 2020–December 2022, focusing on the most critical period of the pandemic response and avoiding unnecessary clutter from early or post-pandemic fluctuations. The visualization uses distinctly colored lines for new confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, making it easier to differentiate between trends. Line thickness and opacity adjustments prevent overlap and ensure that all three variables remain legible. A logarithmic scale was considered but ultimately not used, as absolute values are more intuitive for a general audience. The use of interactive tooltips allows users to retrieve precise numerical values at specific points, addressing a common issue with aggregated visualizations that obscure finer details. However, this approach downplays seasonality, as it presents data in a continuous timeline rather than highlighting patterns within individual years. Additionally, while the animation enhances storytelling, it requires user engagement to fully explore trends, which may be a limitation for passive viewers who prefer a static summary.

				This visualization was designed to improve clarity, precision, and engagement in tracking the trajectory of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths over time. The animated line chart allows users to observe the evolution of pandemic waves dynamically, while interactive elements provide precise numerical values at different points. Unlike the original spiral visualization, which distorted distances and made comparisons difficult, this design presents data on a linear time scale, making it easier to track trends, identify peaks, and compare different phases of the pandemic. The use of distinct colored lines ensures that cases, recoveries, and deaths remain visually separable, while interactivity enhances exploration, allowing users to focus on key moments from March 2020 to December 2022.
			</p>
			<p>
				This redesign directly addresses critiques of the spiral chart by removing ambiguity, improving numerical readability, and eliminating reliance on an external scale key. However, it also introduces new trade-offs. The animation format requires active user engagement to fully explore trends, which may be a barrier for passive viewers. Additionally, while the continuous time-series chart provides a clear narrative of the pandemic's progression, it does not explicitly highlight seasonality as well as the spiral or heatmap alternatives. The lack of side-by-side year comparisons means users must manually navigate to compare distant peaks. Despite these trade-offs, this final design strikes a balance between expressiveness and analytical precision, making pandemic trends both accessible and interpretable for a broad audience.
      		</p> -->
			<p>
				This visualization is designed to clearly convey the year-over-year progression of COVID-19 cases in the United States, while also annotating surges and falls with key public health events, such as vaccine rollouts, variant dominance, and booster approvals. The goal was to maintain the expressive and seasonal visual language of the original spiral plot published by the New York Times, while making the information more structured, interpretable, and contextualized--especially for year-by-year comparison and understanding the drivers behind specific case surges. To do this, I chose to separate the data into three side-by-side radial bar charts, one for each year (2020, 2021, and 2022). This decision serves multiple purposes. First, it improves clarity by isolating each year's data, avoiding the visual overlap and distortion that can occur in a continuous spiral. Second, it allows viewers to compare seasonality and magnitude across years on equal footing, preserving the cyclical structure while emphasizing differences in peak severity. Third, the layout of three concentric, circular plots placed side by side offers a visual nod to the structure of the COVID-19 virus, subtly reinforcing the subject matter while maintaining a clean and editorial aesthetic.
			</p>
			<p>
				The primary mark type is a radial bar chart, which encodes weekly average case counts as bar lengths radiating outward. This form maintains the cyclical structure of time from the original visualization, reinforcing the seasonal recurrence of winter peaks and summer lulls. Although I experimented with showing every data point or averaging by month, I kept the weekly average smoothing transformation to reduce visual noise and make the trends smoother and easier to read, especially in a radial format where sudden spikes can become visually disorienting. To make it easier to quantify the case counts, I included concentric rings within each radial chart, each representing a fixed number of COVID-19 cases. These rings function as internal gridlines, helping the viewer estimate the magnitude of each surge without needing to constantly refer to a separate legend. That said, due to the wide range of case values over the pandemic--from early 2020 to the Omicron wave in early 2022--smaller case counts are sometimes visually minimized in comparison, even though they were significant at the time. This is what I ran into earlier with using a shared linear scale across such a dynamic range with the line plots. The curvature introduces some perceptual distortion, and estimating case counts requires mental interpolation between rings. While I considered differentiating each year with a distinct hue as with my third sketch, I opted for a consistent red palette across all three plots to keep things simple (each year's data was already separated in different radial bar charts). Color was instead used to highlight annotations, which mark key milestones like vaccine authorizations, policy changes, and variant dominance. These are placed outside the radial plots using subtle callout lines, allowing them to contextualize the trends without overwhelming the central data representation.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        My initial critique of the original NYT spiral chart focused on its expressiveness at the cost of clarity: while it effectively showed rising case magnitudes and seasonal rhythms, it struggled with precise quantification and contextual explanation. In redesigning the visualization, I aimed to preserve the emotional impact and seasonal continuity while addressing the critique around quantitative ambiguity and contextual absence. Using intermediate rings as markers to quantify new case counts addressed the need to quantitatively analyze the data. I chose to segment the spiral into separate yearly radial plots directly to address the challenge of clutter and overlapping timelines. It also created space to incorporate annotations for major pandemic milestones, which were missing in the original visualization, to set up the article on what should be expected from the Omicron surge based on historical data. These annotations are important for grounding the viewer's understanding of why certain waves occurred, making the data feel less abstract and more actionable, and I believe this serves an introductory visualization for the article well. However, not all of my critiques were fully resolved. One of my original concerns was that the spiral's shape obscured smaller fluctuations; this still occurs in the radial bars for 2020, where earlier waves are visually minimized relative to Omicron's peak. Additionally, while I considered layering or comparing all three years in a single radial chart or a single line chart, doing so introduced too much clutter or made it difficult to compare seasonally, so I prioritized visual clarity over continuous comparison. I was struggling to strike the perfect balance between clarity and comprehensiveness (being "true" to the continuous nature of the data being represented), and although I didn't resolve it completely, I am happy I chose in favor of clarity for a visualization that is supposed to introduce the readers to an article and give the history of the pandemic at a high level.
